# Cebu Tech Leaders Group

The developers of the world, Pythonistas, node.js fanatics,
Gophers and PHP wizards, they all have their meetups.
They all have peer groups to share and learn from.
What about us technical leaders?

CTOs, team leads, tech leads—whatever your title is,
this group is for you!

## What, when?

We **meet once a month**, in a coffee shop or one of our offices,
For each meetup, there is usually one particular topic,
but we also share and address whatever has come up in one of our companies.

During the month we stay in contact using a **Telegram channel**,
where we share interesting articles, ask questions, plan the next meeting.

One thing we plan is a **members-only conference**,
a gathering of many of our companies developers
to share and present.

## Join

If you want to join **reach out to one of the members**.
At the moment, it's invite-only, as we want to make sure
every member has an interest in actively contributing.
