Introductions were made.

##Talk from Murat on KPI's to measure developer contribution.
Murat originally used a simple Kanban sample, but after getting investors he was required to start generating KPI's to measure performance.


###Thoughts from Murat:
1. Use the minimum number of KPI's possible.
2. Ideas of KPIs
	Downtime.
		Hard to measure true downtime when your project is multi-modular.
	Number of critical bugs found in a week.
	Single points of failure from a server.
	Hiring KPIs based on applicants going through the hiring funnel
	Throughput (and efficiency)

###We discussed how to measure throughput.
	Mark: Decide if you should focus on throughput based on lines written. Or focus on a small number epic goals per quarter.
	Garik: Focus on per week goals (did you accomplish your top priority that week?).
	Albert: The top priority is to maintain a consistent velocity.

###Eric: Discussed briefly how he motivates people
	Throw money and food at the employees (it works).
	Employees can opt into being paid to come in on Saturday and learn.

Javier suggested to measuring downtime on featuers rather then systems.

###Mark suggested that we "test" out happiness at work survey dot com.

###William discussed his story with React Boilerplate and how it's led him to some ideas on how to measure individual employee contributions by using test driven development.

##Discussion started by Albert on a different way to track user stories (inspired by Google Doc's suggestion feature). We call it "State Driven Development".

##Discussion by Mark on how to test effectiveness. And how to do it correctly in the real world. Conversation swinged towards keeping the process of writing code fun (otherwise you might lose your best people). Discussion evolved into how to deal with "business people" in the context of managing expectations and co-designing products.
